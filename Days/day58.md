On the fifty eighth day, I learned the following things about Cloud Computing.

# AWS Demo

- Go to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and create an account. If you don't know then here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKCh9drnc5E) through which you can create it.

- On the upper right side of the corner, you can select a region. If your country's region is not present then choose the nearest one. It will help the data to be fetched quickly.

- The instances of one region won't be present in another region.

- You can check the billing by going to the upper right corner. Click on the name of the account holder and then click on the billing dashboard option.

- It will lead you to the billing dashboard in which you can check your balance and other options.

- If there is some bill that you don't want to pay as a beginner then you can message AWS to cancel your bill.

- To do this click on the question mark on the upper right corner and click on the support center.

- It will lead you to another page. Click on the create case option and check the account and billing option.

- It will open a form for you. Select the billing service from the options.

- Category should a dispute a charge. Click on the additional information button and it will lead you to another page.

- Write the subject the and message to clean and remove the bill by giving them a reason.

- Once you have written the reason, click on the next button to give the contact information and they will contact you and you tell the same reason again.

- After that, click on the submit button.

- The next step is to create an EC2 instance. I have briefly explained it in my ansible [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O4qvZ5M3pE&list=PLptbpfKzsc3BtEki4tHQm5Xmpj8w1_JlM&index=42) or in the nagios [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7O0w-iXg7c&list=PLptbpfKzsc3BtEki4tHQm5Xmpj8w1_JlM&index=51).
