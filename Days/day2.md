On the second day, I learned the following things about Git.

- `git branch` will show the list of branches of Git. Branch is created to divide the data functionalities or use cases.
- `git branch branchname` will create a new branch.
- `git checkout branchname` will help you switch to another branch.
- `git checkout -b branchname` will create a new branch and switch to that branch too.
- `git rebase -i hash value` will merge multiple commits into a single commit.
- `git merge branchname` will merge the branch into another. Here the name of the branch would a branch that you want to merge into another branch.
